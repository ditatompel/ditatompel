# Can't quit (using) vim since 2009

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm ditatompel; another coding nut and Linux enthusiast who can't
quit **using** vim since mid 2009.

If you want to contact me, find my email address from my GPG key below:

- Fingerprint `72D9 225A 5946 08FF 7EE4 2041 31D3 D06D 7795 0979`

## Moving out

As I'm moving my projects to my own git server, this profile will primarily
serve as a legacy platform for maintaining older repos and keeping some public
ones up-to-date. That's it for now! ðŸ™‹
